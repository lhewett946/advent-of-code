### What is this repository for? ###

This repository stores my solutions to the puzzles set as part of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) suite
of programming challenges. I am taking part for fun and to learn more about programming.

### How do I run this code? ###
To get started with running this code, you will need to extract your session cookie from the Advent of Code
website and copy the hexadecimal part of it into a file named session_cookie which you place in the repository root.
The contents of this file are private to you, so DO NOT commit it ANYWHERE. This will allow the code to automatically
obtain your versions of the input files, which it will then cache locally to avoid increasing load on the Advent of Code
server.
